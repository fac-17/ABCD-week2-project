# ABCD Week 2 : To do app

## The project and TDD
The aim of this project is to build a basic To-do app. It will get you started and give you an introduction to unit testing and TDD for client-side code.

### Team
- Francesca
- Emmanuel
- Victor
- Sarah

### Built With

Vanilla Javascript
HTML
CSS

## Goals and User Stories

- [x] Enter tasks I need to do into a web page : 
    * add a new object in the list
- [x] View the tasks I have added in the list
- [x] Mark tasks as complete
- [x] Delete an object from the list
- [x] The to-dos to be large enough


### Potential stretch goals

- [ ] Edit my to-dos if the task changes
- [ ] Click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete
- [ ] A visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with

## Our Journey to create this app
On this project, we decide to mob all together to create the pure functions. As we were all a little bit lost, it was better for us to communicate out loud our thoughts and discuss straight away when we had an idea.

We kinda draw a LOT! But it definitely really helpon the communication inside of the team and for our understanding of the project.
